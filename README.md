# My Katas from codewars.com

Every time I can I've been trying to solve a different coding challenge in codewars.

## Reading their names:
Every kata here is named after:
- The order in which I solved it
- What is the most important thing I learned or reviewed solving it

## What's inside the files:
Commented out are the katas instructions.
Right after that, the solution.

## Why so many comments? Yuck:
- Get over yourself. This repository if sor study purposes.
